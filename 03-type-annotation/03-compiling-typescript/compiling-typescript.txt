Compiling TypeScript
--------------------
- To compile TypeScript code down to plain JavaScript
    - Launch VS Code's Integrated Terminal

    - Type on the terminal
    
        tsc <typescript_file>.ts

    - Corresponding JavaScript file is generated
        - Type annotations in TypeScript 
            - Are removed in the generated JavaScript code

        - Keyword "var" instead of "let" is used
            - Dependent on the compiler's ECMAScript version settings
