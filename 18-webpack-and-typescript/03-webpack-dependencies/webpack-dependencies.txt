Installing Webpack Dependencies
-------------------------------
- Install the initial dev dependencies for Webpack using npm

    npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli typescript ts-loader


- Brief description on each dependency 
    - webpack
        - Installs Webpack, the module bundler

    - webpack-cli
        - To call & use Webpack from the command-line
        - To call from within package.json

        - NOTE: Requires separate installation
            - As it does NOT come bunbled with webpack

    - typescript
        - It is good practice to include TypeScript
            - In the project's "package.json"
        
        - Provide information on the specific version of TypeScript
            - Used in the project
        
    - ts-loader
        - Serves as the middleman between TypeScript and Webpack

        - It calls TypeScript compiler on the command-line
            - To compile the code into JavaScript
        
        - Then hands over to Webpack
            - To bundle everything together
