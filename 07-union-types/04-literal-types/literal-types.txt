Literal Types
-------------
- Literal types are NOT just types
    - BUT LITERALLY the value themselves too
        - e.g. let zero: 0 = 0

    - On its own, it is NOT helpful
        - BUT combining it with Unions
        - Offers a fine-tuned type options for TypeScript to enforce

    - Assigning a new value that is NOT among the declared literal types
        - TypeScript will flag an error


Syntax:

    // Arrow function
    const <name> = (<arg>: <literal_1> | <literal_n> ) => {
        ...
    }

    // Normal function
    function <name>(<arg>: <literal_1> | <literal_n> ) {
        ...
    }
