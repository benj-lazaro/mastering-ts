How We Use TypeScript
---------------------
- The workflow of a locally installed TypeScript
    - Create a file
        - Filename extension of ".ts"

        - NOTE: filename extension ".tsx"
            - TypeScript with JSX syntax
            - Used with the React framework

    - Write TypeScript code in it
        - TypeScript compiler is active while code is written
            - Immediately catches error before runtime
            - Offers tips to address error(s)

        - Save the changes

    - Compile TypeScript code into JavaScript
        - Open VS Code's Integrated Terminal

        - Compile the TypeScript code using tsc (TypeScript compiler)

            tsc <filename>.ts

        - Generate the corresponding JavaScript file
            - On the same directory where the TypeScript file is located
