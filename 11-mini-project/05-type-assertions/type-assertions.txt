Type Assertions
---------------
- A syntax that asserts (informs) TypeScript
    - Specific information about a targeted value's type
        - To TENTATIVELY treat it as a different type

    - It does NOT change the initial type of the targeted value
        - It ONLY changes within the expression (context) that it is used on

    - Demonstrates the concept of Type Assertions in TypeScript


- To implement Type Assertion
    - Append the keyword "as" as the variable storing the targeted value
    - Followed by the specific type 


Syntax:

    let <name> = <value> as <intended_type>;
