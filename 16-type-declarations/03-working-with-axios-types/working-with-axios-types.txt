Working With Axios Types
------------------------
- To implement a basic HTTP request 
    - To a remote API endpoint using Axios
    - Using the method ".get()"
    - Target URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)


- Use the Axios method ".get()"
    - Requires passing the URL as a string value
        - It is expected to return a promise

        - The parsed JSON from the remote API server
            - Is located in "res.data"

    - Then chain the method ".then()"
        - Pass an anonymous arrow function as argument
            
        - The function will display a message on the console
            - If the request has been successful
        
    - Afterwhich chain the method ".error()"
        - Pass an anonymous arrow function as argument

        - The function will display a message on the console
            - If the request failed


- The ".get()" can be type annotated with a custom Type
    - TypeScript can flag an error before runtime when
        - Accessing a property that is NOT part of the custom Type
