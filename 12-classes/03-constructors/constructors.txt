Constructors
------------
- A Constructor is a method (often) defined within a Class
    - It is defined ONLY ONCE

    - It has to be named "constructor"

    - It is automatically called EVERY single time
        - A class is instantiated into an object

    - It holds any form of functionality that WILL BE EXECUTED
        - EVERY time a class is instantiated into an object

        - Often accepts some arguments
            - During instantiating a class into an object 

        - Those arguments (for example) will add / assign values to the corresponding properties
            - Properties inside a Constructor is prefixed with "this." 
    

Syntax:

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <arg>;
            ...
        }

        <method_name>() {
            ...
        }
    }

    const <name> = new <class_name>(<arg_value>, ...);
