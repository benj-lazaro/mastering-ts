Introducing Union Types
-----------------------
- Union types allows to give a value different possible types
    - If the eventual value's type is included
        - TypeScript is happy


- To implement a Union type
    - Use the "|" operator 
        - In-between types that will be included (or considered as valid)

    - It is NOT limited to primtive (built-in) types
        - 

    - NOTE: It is best practice to
        - Be narrow as possible with the types to be included in a union


Syntax:

    const <name>: <type_1> | <type_n> = <value>;
