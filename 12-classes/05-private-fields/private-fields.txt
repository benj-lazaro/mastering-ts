Private Fields
--------------
- Private Class properties (fields)
    - It is just like any normal Class property
        - Defined inside or outside the Constructor method

    - It is prefixed with a "#"
        - This protects the property from being accessed / updated outside of the class

    - The initial value of a Private Class property
        - Can be accessed / updated from within the Class


- To access / update a Private Class property outside of a Class
    - The Private property MUST be enclosed within a Class Method

    - The method references the Private property by
        - Prefixing the property with "this."

    - The method then access / updates the value of a Private property
        - Then returns the requested / updated value
    

- The same syntax can ALSO be applied when defining a Private Class method
    - Prefixing a Class Method with "#"

    - The method is ONLY accessible within the Class


Syntax:

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        <property> = <initial_value>;
        ...
        #<private_property> = <initial_value>;

        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <arg>;
            ...
        }

        // Access value of Private property
        <method_name>(<arg>) {
            this.#<private_property> = <arg>
            ...
            return this.#<private_property>
        }

        // Private method
        #<method_name>(<args>) {
            ...
        }
    }
