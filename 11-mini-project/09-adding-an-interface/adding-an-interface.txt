Adding an Interface
-------------------
- In preparation for storing the To Do items in Local Storage
    - Items needs to be moved from being just a HTML element <li>
        - Into some store of data structure
        - e.g. to do object in an array


- To implement
    - Create an interface named "Todo"
        - A property "text" of type "string"
        - A property "completed" of type "boolean"

    - Declare an array of type "Todo"
        - Initially assign an empty array

    - Create a new object of type "Todo"
        - Assign retrieved value from HTMLInputElement to property "text"
        - Assign "false" as initial value of property "completed"
    
    - Push new object into the array

    - Refactor code
        - Move the HTML element rendered on a separate named function

        - Call the function
            - To create a new Todo object
            - To render associated HTML elements
            - BEFORE pushing the Todo object into the array


- The array can then be stored in Local Storage
    - As well as read from it after starting the app
