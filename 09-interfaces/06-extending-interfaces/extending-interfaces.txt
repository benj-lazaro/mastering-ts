Extending Interfaces 
--------------------
- An Interface can be extended
    - It inherits from another Interface

    - Extending an Interface
        - It can lead to extending multiple Interfaces
        - It is NOT LIMITED to a Single Inheritance Model


- To implement extending an existing Interface to a new Interface
    - After the name of the new Interface
    - Use the keyword "extends"
    - Followed by the name of the parent Interface to inherit from


Syntax:

    interface <name_parent> {
        <property_name>: <type>;
        ...
    }

    // Extend the Parent Interface into the Child Interface
    interface <name_child> extends <name_parent> {
        <property_name>: <type>;
        ...
    }
