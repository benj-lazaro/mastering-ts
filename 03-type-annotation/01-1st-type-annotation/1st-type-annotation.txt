Our First Type Annotation
-------------------------
- To declare a Variable type
    - Assigning a basic (primitive) type to a variable

    - Use the keyword "let"
        - Followed by the variable's name

    - Add ":"
        - Right after the variable name
    
    - Type the (data) type
        - The expected data type to be stored in the variable
            - This is referred to as "Type Annotation"

        - NOTE: Primitive types are written in lowercase


- Strings are typed using the type annontation of "string"


- The TypeScript compiler triggers an error
    - When the variable's value does NOT MATCH with the declared annotated type
        - e.g. number value assigned to a variable annotated with a string


Syntax:

    let | const <variable_name>: string = <string_value>;
