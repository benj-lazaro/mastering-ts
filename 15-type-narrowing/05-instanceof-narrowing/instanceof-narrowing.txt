instanceof Narrowing
--------------------
- The JavaScript operator "instanceof" checks if an object
    - Is an instance of a Class or Constructor function at runtime
    - Is an instance of another (e.g. prototype chain)

    - It used in narrowing the Type when working with classes
        - As well with Arrays, Date
        - Anything that can be instantiated using the keyword "new"
        
    - It is NOT going to do anything for Interfacs and Type Aliases
        - As they do NOT exists in JavaScript


Syntax:

    if (<object> instanceof <class>) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }
