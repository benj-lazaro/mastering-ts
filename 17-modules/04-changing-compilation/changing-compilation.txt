Changing Compilation Module System
----------------------------------
- JavaScript in the browser does NOT know about commonJS modules & syntax
    - It does NOT know about the 
        - keyword "export" & __esModule
        - function require()

    - Despite it worked when running in Node.js 
        - Due to the different ecosystems between
            - Browser JavaScript
            - Node JavaScript

    - The output rendered by TypeScript is NOT browser-friendly


- To address this concern
    - Inform TypeScript to preserve the imports & exports
        - To use the ES6 module syntax
        - In the rendered JavaScript code

    - Open the file "tsconfig.json"
        - Look for the settings "module"
            - By default, it is set to "commonjs"
        
        - Change the assigned value from "commonjs" to "ES6"

        - Save the changes
    
    - On the HTML document's <script> element
        - Add the attribute "type"
        - Assign the value of "module"
        - Save the changes

    - NOTE: Ensure that the HTML document is served from a web server
        - NOT accessing using the "file://" protocol
