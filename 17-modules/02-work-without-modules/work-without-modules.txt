Working Without Modules
-----------------------
- A demonstration of working without using ES Modules


- TypeScript does NOT flag an error when
    - Working with functions on a separate external file during development


- At run-time however JavaScript flags an error
    - Triggers a ReferenceError due to functions NOT defined
        
    - JavaScript specification declares any JavaScript file
        - WITHOUT an "export" or top-level "await"
            - Should be considered a script and NOT a module

        - Inside a script, file variables & types are declared
            - To be in a shared global-scope

        - It assumes that the compiler option "outDir" will be used
            - To join multiple input files into one output file
                - Or use multiple <script> tags in a HTML document
                - To load the files in the correct order
