Interfaces vs Type Aliases
--------------------------
- Despite both being able to accomplish the same thing
    - BUT there are key differences


- Interface
    - Can ONLY DESCRIBE the shape of an object
        - Can NOT be used for anything else

    - Can be re-opened after its creation
        - To add new properties to an existing Interface

    - Uses the keyword "extends"
        - To extend and inherit an existing Interface

        - To extend into a number of other Interfaces
            - Through multiple inheritance


Type Alias
    - Can DESCRIBE ANY sort of type
        - Including an object type

    - Can NOT be re-opened after its creation
        - To add new properties

    - Can NOT work with the keyword "extends"
        - Instead, it uses the intersection operator "& "
