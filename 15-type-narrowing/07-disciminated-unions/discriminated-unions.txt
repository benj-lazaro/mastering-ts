Discriminated Unions
--------------------
- A common pattern in TypeScript that involves
    - A literal property (i.e. discriminant) that is common across multiple Types
        - Assign a Literal Type value to the discriminant
        - Then use the discriminant to narrow down the Type

    - Refers to custom Types that
        - Share a common property
        - The property will be a Literal Type (value)
