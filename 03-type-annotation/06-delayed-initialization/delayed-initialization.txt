Delayed Initialization & Implicit any
-------------------------------------
- To implement a situation wherein
    - Declare a variable (with Type Annotation) separately 
        - From initializing it

    - By not annotating the type assigned to the variable
        - TypeScript infers the variable to be of type "any"
        - NOTE: VS Code hints that the variable implicitly has an "any" type

    - This is NOT ADVISABLE
        - In doing so disables TypeScript's "type checking" feature
        
        - Better to annotate the type of a variable
            - Even when NOT providing an initial value

        - The example demonstrates the importance of Type Annotation
            - It prevents implicit "any"
