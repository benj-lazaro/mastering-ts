Introducting Tuples
-------------------
- Tuple is a special type
    - Exclusive ONLY to TypeScript
    
    - It is an array 
        - With a FIXED LENGTH
        - Items are ORDERED with a FIXED SET of types
    
    - Think of it as a super rigid array


Syntax:

    let <name>: [ <type_1>, <type_n> ];
