Equality Narrowing
------------------
- The Equality Type Guard involves
    - Comparing Types to each other BEFORE performing operations with values


- It employs the operator "===" or "!=="
    - To ensure that both values are the same or NOT
        - Effectively narrowing towards a specific Type
        - BEFORE working with them in a Type-specific way


Syntax:

    // In a conditional statement
    if (<value_1> === <value_2>) {
        // Perform tasks if values are EQUAL
        ...
    } else {
        // Perform tasks if values are NOT EQUAL
        ...
    }
