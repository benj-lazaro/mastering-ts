Working With Array Types
------------------------
- Arrays can be typed 
    - Use Type annontation to specify the type of its items 
        - REQUIRED when working initially with an empty array
        - Otherwise, TypeScript implicitly annontates with the type of "any"
    
    - Then an empty array bracket []
        - NO spaces between the annotated type and the []

    - Next is the "=" operator

    - Followed by either
        - An empty array
        - An array with initial items based on the annotated type
    
    - NOTE: These arrays ONLY allow items of ONE type inside them


Syntax:

    const <name>: <type>[] = [];

    const <name>: <type>[] = [<item_1>, ..., <item_n> ];
