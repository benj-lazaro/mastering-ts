More Array Syntax
-----------------
- Another way to declare an array in TypeScript
    - Use the keyword "Array"
    
    - Followed by the type
        - Enclosed within a pair of < >
    
    - Next is the "=" operator

    - Then the array itself, either as
        - An empty array
        - An array with initial items

    - NOTE: The alternative syntax is a bit clunky
        - Compared to the previous version of declaring an array


- Arrays are NOT ONLY limited to primitive types
    - It can also work with custom types using Type Alias


Syntax:

    const <name>: Array<type> = [];

    const <name>: Array<type> = [<item_1>, ..., <item_n> ];
