Our First Component
-------------------
- Writing our first React functional component using TypeScript


- Open the project folder "shopping-app"
    - Open the folder "src"

    - Create a folder named "components"

    - Open the folder "components"
        - Create a file named "Greeter.tsx"

    - Open the file "Greeter.tsx"
        - Import React 

        - Define a function named "Greeter" that
            - Returns an HTML element <h1> with a string content of "Hello!"

        - Export the function as default

        - Save the changes

    - Open the file "App.tsx"
        - Import the component "Greeter"
            - Place it above the import statement of the "App.css"

        - On the "App" component's JSX markup
            - Render the component "Gretter"

        - Save the changes

    - Run the React app

        npm start


- Back the component "Greeter"
    - Hovering over the declaration of the function Greeter
        - Reveals that it implicitly returns a Type of "JSX.Element"

    - To ensure the Type returned by the function
        - It can be Type Annontated with JSX.Element
        
        - This HELPS avoiding a mistake of
            - Returning a value of different Type (e.g. a string, number)
            - Eventually breaking the app without waraning during development

        - NOTE: Remember to import "JSX" object from the React library

            import React, { JSX } from 'react';
