Webpack Dev Server
------------------
- Few Webpack tweaks during development
    - To address the warning in configuration "The mode option has not been set"
        - Fallback setting is "production"

    - Open the file "webpack.config.js"
        - Add the property "mode"
            - Assign the value "development"
            - NOTE: The property is position BEFORE the property "entry"

        - Save the changes

    - Rebundle and launch web application

        npm run build

        npm start


- Opening the bundled file "bundle.js"
    - The contents is NOT minified


- Next is to use the Webpack Dev Server instead of the lite-server
    - It handles bundling the files in memory
        - Then serves the web application
        - By clicking the generated local URL

    - To install the webpack-dev-server via npm
        
        npm i --save-dev webpack-dev-server

    - Open the file "package.json"
        - Rename the script "start" with "serve"
        - Rename the assigned value to "webpack serve"
        - Save the changes

    - Open the file "webpack.config.js"
        - Add a new property "devServer"
            - Assign an object as value
            - Inside the object, add the property "directory"
            - Assign the value 'path.join(__dirname, "./")'
            - NOTE: The property "devServer" is position RIGHT AFTER "devtool"

        - On the property "output"
            - Add a new property named "publicPath"
            - Assign the value "/dist"

        - Save the changes
