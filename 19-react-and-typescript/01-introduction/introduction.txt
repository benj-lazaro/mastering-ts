React & TypeScript Introduction
-------------------------------
- This section focuses on
    - React with TypeScript
    - How to use React Types
    - How to create React app with TypeScript


- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
    - It uses vanilla JavaScript BUT can add-in TypeScript Types
        - Similarly to importing Types from the DefinitelyTyped repository
            - It carries Types for React

            - Types that can manually be added in to some React application
                - e.g. interface ReactComponentElement and more

            - GitHub Repository (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/react)

    - Website (https://react.dev/)


- To create a React app with TypeScript integrated using the script "create-react-app"
    - Open the terminal and use the command:

        npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
        
        - Creates a React app
            - Includes a TypeScript config file (tsconfig.json)

        - Creates .tsx files instead of .jsx files
        
        - Takes care of converting current React apps 
            - From using vanilla JavaScript to TypeScript

        - Reference (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript)


- Alternatively, TypeScript Types can be added into a React app
    - By installing them using yarn:

        yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
