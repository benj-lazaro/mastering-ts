Optional Properties
-------------------
- With object types
    - It is possible to make some of its properties optional

    - When defining the properties an object type using Type Alias
        - Place the operator "?"
        - Right AFTER the name of the property
        - BEFORE the ":" operator & its assigned types
    
    - This informs TypeScript that the targeted property that
        - Is NOT required and OPTIONAL
        
        - Leaving it unincluded when used with a constant, function or variable
            - TypeScript will NOT flag an error


Syntax:

    type <name> = {
        <property_name>: <type>;
        ...
        <optional_property_name>?: <type>:
    };
