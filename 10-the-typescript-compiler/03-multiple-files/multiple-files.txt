Working With Multiple Files
---------------------------
- To compile multiple TypeScript Files 
    - All located within the same directory

    - Launch the TypeScript compiler without attaching a target files

        tsc

    - TypeScript looks for TypeScript files (.ts) and compiles them

    - Optional: launch TypeScript with the "-w" option

        tsc -w
