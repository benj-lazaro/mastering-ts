Building The ToDo List
----------------------
- An HTML element <ul> with the id of "todolist"
    - Will store the entries submitted by the HTML element <input>

    - For each entry
        - A corresponding HTML element <li> is created
            - With the entry as content

        - A checkbox alongside each entry
