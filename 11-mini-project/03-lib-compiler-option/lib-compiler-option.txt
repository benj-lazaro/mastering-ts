The lib Compiler Option
-----------------------
- By default, TypeScript knows the type definitions of the DOM
    - All its methods for elements
    - Element methods
    - Events
    - Interfaces


- These features can be turned off for the following use cases:
    - App will NOT run in a browser

    - App runtime platform provide certain JavaScript API objects
        - That does NOT YET support the full syntax of a given ECMAScript version

    - App using polyfills or native implementations of a higher level ECMAScript version
        - Than the one assigned in the "target" option


- To disable
    - Open the "tsconfig.json" file
    
    - Search for the option "lib"
        - Under the section "Language and Environment"

    - Uncomment the option "lib"
        - By default, assigned with an empty []
        - Effectively disables TypeScript's default type definitions


- To manually add new or existing components, modules or libraries with "lib" enabled  
    - Include the name of the corresponding high-level library or individual components
        - As an item of the "lib" option's []
