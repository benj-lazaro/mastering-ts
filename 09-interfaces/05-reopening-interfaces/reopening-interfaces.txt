Reopening Interfaces
--------------------
- An Interface can be re-opened
    - To add new properties after its creation
        - This is unique to an Interface
        - Type Alias does NOT OFFER this features

    - Adding a new property into an Interface
        - Does NOT OVERRIDE the existing Interface
        - It appends the new properties into itself

    - Use Case
        - Add a property to an existing Interface of a 3rd party library


Syntax:

    interface <name_a> {
        <property_name_1>: <type>;
  
    }

    // The additional property gets appended into the existing interface
    interface <name_a> {
        <property_name_2>: <type>;
  
    }
