Getters
-------
- It is a piece of syntatic sugar that
    - Creates a synthetic property in a Class
    
    - It behaves and is called like a normal property
    
    - It can add some additional logic into it
    
    - Executes like a method without the pair of ()
        - Whose function to is return (get) a value of a property
        - Quite useful for returning the stored value in a Private Property (Field)
            

- To implement a Getter
    - Define a normal Class Method
    - Prefix the name of the method with the keyword "get"


Syntax:

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        <property> = <initial_value>;

        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <arg>;
            ...
        }

        get <name>() {
            ...
        }
    }
