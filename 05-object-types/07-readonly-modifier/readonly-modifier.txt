The readonly Modifier
---------------------
- The object types have a special modifier keyword "readonly"
    - This is NOT a JavaScript keyword

    - It marks an object's property as READ-ONLY
        - When an attempt to update / write on said property
            - TypeScript flags an error

        - The property can be read from
            - But can NOT be written on


- To implement within a Type Alias of an object type
    - Place the keyword "readonly" before the targeted property


Syntax:

    type <name> = {
        readonly <property_name>: <type>;
        ...
    };
