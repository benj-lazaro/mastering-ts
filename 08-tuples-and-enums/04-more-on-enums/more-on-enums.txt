A Bit More On Enums
-------------------
 - Enums created without any specified values on its members
    - TypeScript IMPLICTLY assigns numeric values to each member
        - Starts at 0 and going up

    - It can be EXPLICTLY changed
        - Using the "=" operator and then assigning either 
            - A number type
                - Increments the number from the assigned number
                - Separate number value for each member

            - A string type


- Enums members does NOT have to be homogenous
    - It can have a mix of number and string type members
