Setters
-------
- It is a piece of syntatic sugar that
    - Creates a synthetic property in a Class
    
    - It behaves and is called like a normal property
    
    - It can add some additional logic into it
    
    - Executes like a method without the pair of ()
        - Whose function is to access and set a new value to a property
        
        - Offers the ability to intercept & verify 
            - The new value prior to assigning to a property

        - Quite useful for updating the stored value in a Private Property (Field)


- To implement a Getter
    - Define a normal Class Method
    - Prefix the name of the method with the keyword "set"


Syntax:

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        <property> = <initial_value>;

        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <arg>;
            ...
        }

        set <name>() {
            ...
        }
    }
