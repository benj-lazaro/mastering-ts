Introducing Generics
--------------------
- Generic is a special feature that allows
    - To define a reusable class or function that 
        - Can work with multiple types
        - These are NOT Union Types

    - It can accept any type
        - Then return the same type


- A built-in Generic representative is the array's alternative syntax
    - It uses the interface "Array"
        - Followed by the type of the elements enclosed within <>
        - e.g. Array<number>, Array<string>, Array<boolean>

    - Hovering the mouse pointer over "Array"
        - VS Code shows the syntax
        
            interface Array<T>

        - The "T" represents a generic type 


    - The interface "Array" is written in a generic way that 
        - It accepts any sort of type
        - It stores (or returns) elements based on the given type
