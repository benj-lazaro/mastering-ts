Intersection Types
------------------
- Refers to multiple types created using Type Alias
    - Then combining them using the "&" operator


- To add a new property of an "intersected" type
    - Use the "&" operator
    - Followed by the property enclosed in a pair of { }


Syntax:

    type <type_name_1> = {
        <property>: <type>;
        ...
    }

    type <type_name_2> = {
        <property>: <type>;
        ...
    }

    // Direct intersection of previous types
    type <type_name_3> = <type_name_1> & <type_name_1>;

    // Intersection of previous types with additional properties
    type <type_name_4> = <type_name_1> & <type_name_1> & {
        <property>: <type>;
        ...
    };
