Truthiness Guard
----------------
- Truthiness Type Guards
    - Checks the value for being truthy or falsy BEFORE working with it

    - Helps avoid errors when a value MIGHT be of type "null" or "undefined"
        - Implmented as a form of Type Guard

    - Employs the "!" operator on a value (or operand) in a conditional statement
        - Evaluates to true if the value is falsy
        - Otherwise, evaluates to false

    - Common use case
        - Dealing with a value that could either be a non-null or null (or undefined) value
    

Syntax:

    // In a conditional statement
    if (!<value>) {
        ...
    } else {
        ...
    }


    // In an arrow function
    const <name> = (<value>?: <primitive_value>) {
        ...
    }
