A Note On React Function Component
----------------------------------
- On other TypeScript courses
    - Writes a Function Component (FC) using
        - An older syntax
        - Type annotates using React.FC

            const <variable>: React.FC = () => {
                ...
            }


    - NOTE: This syntax though still supported
        - General consensus today is that React.FC is discouraged
