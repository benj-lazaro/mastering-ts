Excess Properties
-----------------
- With regards to object parameters in a function
    - Passing an object as an (inline) argument value to a function

        <function_name>({<property>: <value>, ...}); 

    - If the object contains a property NOT defined
        - In the function's parameter list
        - TypeScript will flag an error


    - HOWEVER, with the same object separately assigned to a constant / variable
        - Pass said constant / variable as argument to the same function
        - TypeScript will NOT flag an error

        let <constant_name> = {<property>: <value>, ...};
        
        <function_name>(<variable>);

    - What happends under the hood
        - TypeScript checks ONLY the properties
            - Defined in the function's parameter list
            - IGNORES the excess properties that came with the object 

        - NOTE: This was a design choice made early in TypeScript generally
