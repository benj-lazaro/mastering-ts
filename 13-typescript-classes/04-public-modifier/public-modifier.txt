The public Modifier
-------------------
- The prefix "public" modifier on a Class Property
    - Every Property and Method of a Class is IMPLICITLY "public" by default

    - This meant that they can be ACCESSED (read) from outside the class

    - This is implemented ONLY for readability to
        - EXPLICITLY indicate w/c Class members are "public"
        
        - Make it clear for other developers that
            - The value on said property is accessible & changeable

    - This modifier is UNIQUE to TypeScript


Syntax:

    class <name> {
        <property_name>: <type>;
        public <property_name>: <type>;
        ...

        constructor(<paramter>: <type>) {
            this.<property> = <paramter>;
            ...
        }

    }
