TypeScript Overview
-------------------
- Static Checking is a feature that 
    - Looks & detects errors in the code
        - Without executing the code or before runtime


- TypeScript is a "Static Type Checker"
    - It perform the same pre-runtime Static Checking

    - Based its checks on the type or kinds of data used in the code
        - e.g. string, number, object w/ particular set of properties

    - This type system helps
        - Find errors
        - Analyze code while being typed
        - BUT it ONLY EXISTS in development


- TypeScript's workflow
    - Type code in TypeScript
        - Detect and fix identified errors in code

    - Compile the (TypeScript) code into regular JavaScript code
        - With the "strict mode" enabled
        - To be run on a browser or Node.js environment
