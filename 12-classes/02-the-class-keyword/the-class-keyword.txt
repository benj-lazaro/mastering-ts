The class Keyword
-----------------
- A Class allows to create a pattern (i.e. blueprint or template) that
    - Describes an object
        - Including its properties and functionality (i.e. methods)
    
    - Then instantiate an instance (of itself... i.e. class) into an object

    - A Class is NOT the same as an Interface or Type Alias
        - These two describes the shape of an object
        - They do NOT create or instantiate into an object


Syntax:

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <value>;
            ...
        }

        <method_name>() {
            ...
        }
    }


    const <name> = new <class_name>(<arg_value>, ...);
