Type Inference
--------------
- It refers to TypeScript compiler's ability
    - To infer types based on the assigned value (to a variable)

    - TypeScript can remeber a value's types
        - Without being dependent on Type Annotation
        - Enforces the inferred type moving forward

    - NOTE: There is a place for Type Annotations
        - BUT for most of the time, it is NOT needed
