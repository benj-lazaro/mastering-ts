Nested Objects
--------------
- A nested object type annotations uses
    - The same syntax as a normal object type annotation
    
    - EXCEPT that some of its properties have 
        - Nested object assigned as value
    

- Best implement using a Type Alias
    - Due to the complexity or multiple properties of the object

    - Annotating an inline argument with a nested object type
        - While doable it results to writing ugly code
