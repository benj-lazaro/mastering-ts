What's The Point Of Webpack
---------------------------
- This section focuses on using TypeScript with Webpack
    - This is OPTIONAL
    
    - TypeScript can be used in all sort of situations where
        - Webpack will be used or not


- Webpack (https://webpack.js.org/)
    - Helps take complex applications that consists of
        - Hundreds of different files with dependencies
            - Importing & exporting things
            - Splitting into different files & 3rd party libraries

    - It creates bundles
        - Combines, compress said files into small(ish) bundles that 
            - Can be included into a website / web application 
            - Relevant to today's web applications with the rise of single-page apps (SPA)
        
        - Make few HTTP requests (as possible) to download & load
            - Download the corresponding JavaScript libraries
            - Load them in the right order

    - It balances two (2) concerns
        - Every separate script lead to a new HTTP request in the browser
            - This can lead to a bottleneck
            - Make things VERY SLOW

        - Writing code in one (1) single file
            - Is an absolute nightmare


    - It takes a ton of different assets
        - Bundles them together into static assets (a file or files)
        - Load the bundle as a single script

    - This section focuses on how to tell Webpack to
        - Treat and handle TypeScript files as TypeScript
