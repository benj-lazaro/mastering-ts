Production Configuration
------------------------
- To setup a "production" configuration for Webpack using:

        npm run build

    - That co-exists with the "development" configuration using:
    
        npm run serve


- Create a separate Webpack configuration file
    - Open and copy the contents of the file "webpack.config.js"
    - Save it as "webpack.prod.js"
    - NOTE: It MUST be on the same location as the original file


- Open the file "webpack.prod.js"
    - Change the assigned value of the property "mode"
        - From "development" to "production"

    - Save the changes


- Open the file "package.json"
    - Change the assigned value of the property "build"
        - From "webpack" to "webpack --config webpack.prod.js"

    - Save the changes


- To distinguish the configuration files between "development and "production"
    - Rename "webpack.config.js" to "webpack.dev.js"
        - From "webpack-dev-server" to "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js"

    - Open the file "package.json"
        - Change the assigned value of the property "webpack-dev-server"
            - To "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js"


- Add a special plug-in named ""
    - It cleans out the contents of "./dist" folder for every build
        - Relevant when using "[contenthash]"
            - On the property "output" of the "webpack.prod.js"
        
                output: {
                    filename: "[contenthash]bundle.js",
                    ...
                }

         - Generates a unique "<hash>bundle.js" file for every build
            - Accumulates files over time


    - To install the plugin

        npm i --save-dev clean-webpack-plugin


    - To configure Webpack to use the plugin
        - Open the file "webpack.prod.js"

        - Require the Webpack plugin

            const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require("clean-webpack-plugin");

        - Add a property named "plugins" right after "output"
            - Assign an array as value
        
        - Inside the array, add the plugin as an element

            new CleanWebpackPlugin()

        - Save the changes
            - Run a build

                npm run build

        - Clears the previous generated files in the "./dist" directory
            - Leaves the current build in place
            - NOTE: May take a while to clean the directory
