The never Type
--------------
- The "never" type represent a value that NEVER occurs
    - It is used to annotate a function that
        - ALWAYS (intended to) throw an exception
        - NEVER finishes executing (e.g. in a continuous loop)

    - This type is unique to TypeScript
        - NOT commonly used

    - Failing to annotate an intended function with type "never"
        - TypeScript will infer the type "void" instead


- NOTE: The type "void" !== "never"
    - The former (behind the scenes) returns the value of type "undefined" or "null"
        - Technically "void" is a type of value

    - The latter refers to a function that
        - Does NOT return anything at all
        - Continues to execute
