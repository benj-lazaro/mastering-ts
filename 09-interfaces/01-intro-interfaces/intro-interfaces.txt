Introducing Interfaces
----------------------
- Interfaces serve ALMOST the exact same purpose as Type Aliases
    - With a SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT syntax
        - It does NOT use the "=" operator as the Type Alias

    - It is used to create reusable, modular types
        - That describe the shape of an object & ONLY for an object
        - Including its properties & methods


Syntax:

    interface <name> {
        <property_name>: <type>;
        ...
    }
