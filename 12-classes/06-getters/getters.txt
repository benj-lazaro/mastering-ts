- It is a piece of syntatic sugar that helps
    - Add some additional logic

    - Create synthetic properties that 
        - Looks and is called like a property
        - It runs corresponding logic like a method

    - Prefix the keyword "get"
    - Followed by a named Class method

    class <CamelcaseName> {
        <property> = <initial_value>;

        constructor(<arg>) {
            this.<property> = <arg>;
            ...
        }

        get <name>() {
            ...
        }
    }
