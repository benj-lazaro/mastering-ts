The files Compiler Option
-------------------------
- The "files" is a Top-Level or root option in the "tsconfig.json" file
    - It is of the SAME LEVEL as the "compilerOptions"

    - It requires a list of files stored inside a pair of [ ]
        - Each TypeScript file is enclosed within a pair of " "        
        - Each file is separated by a "," from each other

        - This lists out MANUALLY specific files to be compiled
            - Everything else will be IGNORED by the TypeScript compiler

    - NOTE: Best used for smaller projects or group of files

    - Reference: (https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#files)


Syntax:

    {
        "compilerOptions": {
            ...
        },
        "files": [
            "<filename>.ts",
            "<filename>.ts",
            ...
        ]
    }
