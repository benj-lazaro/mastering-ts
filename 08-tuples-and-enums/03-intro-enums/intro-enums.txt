Introducing Enums 
-----------------
- Enums defines a set of named constants
    - These constants can have number or string type values
        
    - This is UNIQUE to TypeScript
        - Does NOT exists in JavaScript

    - Often used 
        - When consistently referencing a set of value w/in the code

    - By convention
        - Enum name uses the CamelCase naming convention
        - Enum members are all capitalized

    - The implict value assigned to Enum members
        - Can be changed EXPLICTLY using the "=" operator
        - Followed by the corresponding value (number or string type)


Syntax:

    enum <name> {
        <name> [ = <number_or_string_type_value> ],
        ...
    }
