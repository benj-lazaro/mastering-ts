Introducing Type Declarations
-----------------------------
- Type declaration files are special files in TypeScript
    - Ends with file extension ".d.ts"
    
    - These are referred as "declaration files"
    
    - These files ONLY contain Type information or declarations of Types
        - They contain NO code, NO implementation details (i.e. logic)
        - They do NOT produce any ".js" outputs
        - They are ONLY used for type checking

    - TypeScript looks at this file
        - To understand & enforce Type rules on the code

        - The actual code is written & saved in a ".ts" file
            - That will be converted & executed as ".js" file

        - The ".d.ts" file contains impoertant Type information
