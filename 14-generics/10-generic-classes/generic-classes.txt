Writing Generic Classes
-----------------------
- To implement a Generic Class
    - The concept behind is similar to that of a Generic Function

    - Explicitly declared <T> after the class name

    - When instantiating the Class into an object
        - Explicitly pass the type enclosed in a pair of <>
        - In-between the class name and pair of ()




Syntax:

  class <name><T> {
    <property_name>: <type>;
    ...

    <method_name>(<parameter>: T) {
        this.<property_name> = <initial_value>;
        ...
    }
  }


  // Instantiating Class into an object
  const <object_name> = new <class_name><type>();
  
  object_name.<method>();
