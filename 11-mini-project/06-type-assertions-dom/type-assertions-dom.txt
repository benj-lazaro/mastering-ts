Type Assertions with the DOM 
----------------------------
- An alternative syntax for Type Assertions
    - Instead of using the keyword "as"
        - Followed by the intended type

    - Uses a pair of <> with the intended type in-between
        - Followed by the targeted element or value

    - NOTE: Less common in general
        - Does NOT work with React's JSX template mark-up

        - JSX "freaks out" due to the <>
            - Being use for writing the template mark-up
            - Requires to use fragments <>...</> to make it work

        - Syntax is used when working with Generics

        - Using the "as" keyword is easier to read 


Syntax:

    (<intended_type><target_element>).<method_or_propery>;
