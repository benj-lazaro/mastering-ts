The void Type
-------------
- The "void" is a return type (ONLY) for functions
    - It does NOT RETURN anything
    
    - It is best used for a function that 
        - Is NOT expected to return anything

    - TypeScript can infer the type "void" faily well
        - It is best to EXPLICITLY annotate the function's return value

    - Without EXPLICITLY annotating the type "void"
        - It is possible to insert a "return" statement inside the function
        - Without triggering a TypeScript error
