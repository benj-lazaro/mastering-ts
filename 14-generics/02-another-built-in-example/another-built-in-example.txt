Another Example of a Built-In Generic
-------------------------------------
- Another built-in Generic is the "document.queryselector()"
    - A method that accepts a type of "<keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>"
        - The argument comes in the form of a CSS styled Selector

    - It returns a value that is either an "Element" or null
        - Element is the MOST basic of object

    - To assert a specific type to the method ".queryselector()"
        - Place the specific type in a pair of <>
        - Position in-between the method and its pair of ()
        - Returns the specific type (instead of an Element) or null 

    - Use the Non-null Assertion operator "!"
        - To inform TypeScript that a non-null value is guaranteed


Syntax:

    const <name> = document.queryselector<specific_type>()!;
