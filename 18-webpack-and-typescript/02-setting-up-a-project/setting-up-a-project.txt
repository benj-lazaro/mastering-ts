Setting Up A Project
--------------------
- Setup a project 
    - With a few different BUT connected files
    - Then later create a Webpack bundle from it


- The sample project demonstrates
    - Each JavaScript file is loaded successively by the browser


- If a dependency is imported Types into another dependency of the index.ts file
    - TypeScript will NOT flag an error
    
    - However, during runtime JavaScript will flag an error
        - It fails to resolve the module (with Types)
        
        - As noted in the section Modules
            - Types are NOT imported after .ts is compiled into .js
            - There is/are NO corresponding .js file(s) generated
    
    - To address this concern
        - Webpack is one of the few solutions

        - To create a bundle
            - Include all related files / dependencies
            - Load them in the correct order
