More On Tuples 
--------------
- In addition to being an array of FIXED LENGTH
    - Tuples can have items of different types

    - Provided it STRICTLY FOLLOWS the ORDER
        - Of the items and its corresponding types
        - TypeScript flags an error when the order is violated


- NOTE: TypeScript's WEIRD Tuple design & implementation
    - AFTER a tuple is CREATED, TypeScript does NOT PREVENT
        - New items being pushed in to the tuple
        - Existing items from being popped off from the tuple

    - It has something to do with how JavaScript arrays work
        - It is a limitation of tuples

    - Good news is that tuples are NOT that used very much
        - Implemented on situation to store
            - Simple data that are instrinsically linked
                - e.g. RGB or HSL colors

            - For complex data, use an object instead
                - e.g. HTTP response code & corresponding status message
    

Syntax:

    // Custom type of tuple
    type <tuple_name> = [<type_1>, ..., <type_n>];

    // Array of tuples
    const <array_name>: <tuple_name>[] = [];

    <array_name>.push(<tuple_item>);
    
    <array_name>.pop();
